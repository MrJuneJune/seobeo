**warning**: Still WIP so don't use it for anything production related. 

Seobeo is a lightweight C server built for educational and personal projects. I made this because I got tired of ever changing API libraries and always wanted to write a proper server in C. It's way easier to reason about from the ground up.

## How to run 
```bash
make example
```

## TODO

- Basic CSRF token for forms.

- Write simple tests for basic cases 

- Websockets

- Dockerize it?
